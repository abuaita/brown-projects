### Description ###

Swiftfeed is a simple web page that uses AJAX/Jquery to display the most recent 26 tweets about Taylor Swift.

### Design Decisions ###

I chose to display each tweet on its own line for readability. Other design decisions 
were the use of rounded edges for all elements including the tweets, the profile images,
and floating buttons. 

### Bugs ###
None known.
